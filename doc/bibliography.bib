  abstract = {The Hadamard product of two matrices multiplied together elementwise is a rather neglected concept in matrix theory and has found only brief and scattered application in statistical analysis. We survey the known results on Hadamard products in a historical perspective and obtain various extensions. New applications to multivariate analysis are developed with complicated expressions appearing in closed form. These lead to new results concerning Hadamard products of positive definite matrices. The paper ends with an exhaustive bibliography of books and articles related to Hadamard products.},

  Abstract                 = {We provide stronger and more general primal-dual convergence results for Frank-Wolfe-type algorithms (a.k.a. conditional gradient) for constrained convex optimization, enabled by a simple framework of duality gap certificates. Our analysis also holds if the linear subproblems are only solved approximately (as well as if the gradients are inexact), and is proven to be worst-case optimal in the sparsity of the obtained solutions. On the application side, this allows us to unify a large variety of existing sparse greedy methods, in particular for optimization over convex hulls of an atomic set, even if those sets can only be approximated, including sparse (or structured sparse) vectors or matrices, low-rank matrices, permutation matrices, or max-norm bounded matrices. We present a new general framework for convex optimization over matrix factorizations, where every Frank-Wolfe iteration will consist of a low-rank update, and discuss the broad application areas of this approach.},

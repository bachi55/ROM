# Retention Order Support Vector Machine (ROSVM)

ROSVM is a [Ranking Support Vector Machine (RankSVM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking_SVM) implementation for retention order prediction of liquid chromatography (LC) retention times (RT). It was initally proposed by [Bach et al. (2018)](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/17/i875/5093227). 

This library aims to be a more self-containt implementation, alowing the user to easily train models and make predictions.
